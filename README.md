Learning opportunity for [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [Solid-JS](https://www.solidjs.com/) implemented entirely in Typescript.

Lots of sharp edges still with how to appropriately setup all four to be happy, but works well now.

Hopefully this can help serve as a better template for those wanting to experiment with these projects.
